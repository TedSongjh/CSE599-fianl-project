## Related Work

Other people are out there doing things. What did they do? Was it good? Was it bad? Talk about it here.

## Approach

How did you decide to solve the problem? What network architecture did you use? What data? Lots of details here about all the things you did. This section describes almost your whole project.

Figures are good here. Maybe you present your network architecture or show some example data points?

## Results

How did you evaluate your approach? How well did you do? What are you comparing to? Maybe you want ablation studies or comparisons of different methods.

You may want some qualitative results and quantitative results. Example images/text/whatever are good. Charts are also good. Maybe loss curves or AUC charts. Whatever makes sense for your evaluation.
